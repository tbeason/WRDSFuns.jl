`WRDSFuns.jl` is a helper package for working with some of the datasets from Wharton Research Data Services. I have no affiliation with WRDS.

I built this package to help move a lot of my previous SAS work into Julia. It is very much a work in progress. As the Julia data-ecosystem evolves, so will this package.
